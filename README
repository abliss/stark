What is Stark?
=============

Stark is an attempt at a web-based visual mud. It is built using only open
technologies that revolve around the browser:

* All client-server interactions are RESTful_, which therefore means that
anyone can write clients and apps in any language that interact with that world

* Server-side is Django_ served by Apache with mod-wsgi using django_piston_
for the REST api and sqlite3 as the db (for now)

* Client-side is Javascript using processing.js_ ( which uses the HTML5
<canvas> element) for the graphics and jQuery_ for the REST calls and
UI

* Uses the HTML5 <canvas> element

Requirements
============

You need django and django-piston installed (links above). There are right now
no other requirements and as much as possible I'd like to keep it that way.

Installation
============

This is a full django project, it can't just be installed as an app. Maybe
once django supports nested apps... so, for now:

* add the stark package to the Python path

* syncdb:
$ python manage.py syncdb, name the created user 'admin'

* start the server:
$ python manage.py runserver

* login to the admin side at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin (you need to do this
otherwise it will create an anonymous account when you load the game)

* load the game at http://127.0.0.1:8000
